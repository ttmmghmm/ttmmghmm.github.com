#' Get the expiration date of an instrument given it's primary_id
#'
#' \code{primary2expiry} is basically a wrapper for \code{\link{suffix2expiry}}.  It uses
#' \code{\link[FinancialInstrument]{parse_id}} to split the \code{primary_id} into rood_id and suffix_id.
#' then it calls the appropriate \code{\link{suffix2expiry}} method.
#'
#' \code{suffix2expiry} is a generic-like function.  There should be a method defined
#' the &quot;root_id&quot;.  Currently, written methods include &quot;VX&quot;, &quot;ES&quot; (and aliases &quot;YM&quot;, &quot;NQ&quot;).
#' There are links to methods help pages in the seealso section.
#'
#' @param primary_id character string.  Primary identifier of the instrument
#' @param root character string. root symbol like &quot;ES&quot; or &quot;VX&quot; (NULL)
#' @param silent silence warnings? (TRUE)
#' @param suffix character string that indicates expiration month and year (and, for options, right and strike).
#' See \code{\link[FinancialInstrument]{parse_suffix}} for examples of acceptable formats.
#' @param ... any arguments to be passed to the \code{suffix2expiry} method
#' @return expiration Date
#' @seealso \code{\link{suffix2expiry.VX}}, \code{\link{suffix2expiry.ES}}
