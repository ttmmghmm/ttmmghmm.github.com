```{r}
library(dplyr)
pathToFilename <- R.home()  %>% 
  list.files(full.names = TRUE, patt = ".*txt$", recur = TRUE, include.dirs = TRUE)
pathToFilename %>% head
bigFiles <- pathToFilename %>% 
  sapply(function(xx) file.info(xx)$size) %>%
  sort(decr = TRUE) %>%
  head(n = 10)
bigFiles
(oneFile <- names(bigFiles[2]))
tmp <- oneFile %>% readChar(file.info(.)$size)
# count how many "\n" there are in the output. e.g.
length(gregexpr("\n", tmp)[[1L]])

```

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r, echo=FALSE}
plot(cars)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
