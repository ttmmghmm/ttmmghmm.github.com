* S&P 500 ($SPX) closes down more than 1% for three straight days.
* Each close is a new 20-day low.
* The final close on the third day is below the 200-day moving average.

```{r}
momersion <- function(R, n, returnLag = 1) {
  momentum <- sign(R * lag(R, returnLag))
  momentum[momentum < 0] <- 0
  momersion <- runSum(momentum, n = n)/n * 100
  colnames(momersion) <- "momersion"
  return(momersion)
}

```
